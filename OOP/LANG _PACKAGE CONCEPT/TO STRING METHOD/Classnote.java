/* from java version 1.8 onwards we can execute the class without the class by using " interface" keyword.
   for every "java class" parent_class is "object class and it have 11 default methods" and object class belongs to the "lang_package".
   (NOTE: "No need import the object class by default object class is there by inheretencce")
